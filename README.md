# Prebootcamp Web Development - Ironhack

Welcome to the preliminary phase of the course! 

If you have finished in this repository is because at some point in the prework or at the beginning of the course you have been forced to postpone your adventure.

For the Ironhack team it is very important that you start off on the right foot and that is why we have these five new exercises and an old acquaintance.

The goal is that you complete them all without any help other than the documentation you have in the Student Portal. Cheating is not the way to success, we guarantee it.

The exercises are the following:

FizzBuzz
Nightclub bouncer 
The Fibonacci Pairs 
Leap years
The letter of the DNI 
And the special guest... Mars Rover Kata 

The deadline for submitting these exercises will be one week before the start of the course. You must send the link to your repository to the email: ta-web-mad@ironhack.com
